# Documentations

[Visit the website](https://yu14y.github.io/Set-Of-marker-Colors-Template/) 

Reminder, this is the 2022 course. i will not update to future courses. A flawless Set of Marker Color is from Freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Course. This Repo was created to showcase the website. I will not be explaining any html elements or any css code as i believe users may use this repo to finish the course quickly. I wish that you read all the resources first, so u will understand everything better and understand every part of it. This Repo was created since [Yu14 Ywen (the Owner of this Repo)](https://github.com/Yu14Y) was taking the course on Freecodecamp. I wish to remind you that. Everything in the index.html & styles.css file was the output of the course.

I will not be merging any PR related to index.html or styles.css but other PR that will improve the readme will be merged.
